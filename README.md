# Scraping environmental sanctions for people and companies in Colombia
 This scraper gets every environment sanction in Colombia from 2015 to 2022 using Python/Selenium.
 I have visited [this website](http://vital.minambiente.gov.co/SILPA_UT_PRE/RUIA/ConsultarSancion.aspx?Ubic=ext) and then chose a start ("fecha desde") and end ("fecha hasta") date to search for. There were hundreds of pages.
 The outcome CSV can be found [here](https://github.com/luizftoledo/scraping-colombia-environmental-sanctions/tree/main/outcome).
